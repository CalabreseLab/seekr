### Description:
# filter gencode fasta file by 1: length; 2: transcript feature type and Ensemble_canonical tag 3: transcript feature type and isoform number 4: remove duplicated sequences

### Details:
# please use gencode downloaded fasta and gtf files as input, other formats are not tested
# please make sure the fasta and gtf files are from the same release and same species
# if canonical filtering is turned on, only sequences that has the feature type 'transcript' and has a tag 'Ensembl_canonical' will be kept
# if isoform filtering is turned on, only sequences that has the feature type 'transcript' and has a transcript_name ('Gm37180-201') that contains the isoform number (201) will be kept
# isoform number support regular expression, for example, '[0-9]01' will match 101, 201, 301 up to 901.
# please quote the full argument, like '[0-9]01', if using regular expression in command line to avoid errors.
# if rm_dup is set to True, sequences that are exactly the same will be removed and only the first occurence will be kept
# if more than 50 transcript_ids in gtf file (after filtering by either Ensemble_canonical tag or isoform) cannot be matched to the input fasta headers, a warning message will be printed
# transcript_id in gtf file is located inside the 9th field
# transcript_id in the fasta headers is the first element of the header split by |
# transcript_name in gtf file is also located inside the 9th field
# these are standard formats from gencode


### Input:
# fasta_path: path to the fasta file that needs to be filtered
# gtf_path: path to the gtf file that corresponds to/matches the fasta file
# if canonical filtering is not needed, then set gtf_path=None, meaning you don't need to provide a gtf file
# len_threshold: the length threshold for filtering, if no length filtering is needed, set len_threshold=0 (default)
# canonical: whether to filter by feature type as 'transcript' and tag as 'Ensemble_canonical', if no canonical filtering is needed, set canonical=False (default)
# if canonical filtering is needed, please make sure to provide a gtf file that matches the fasta file
# if canonical filtering is turned on, only sequences that has the feature type 'transcript' and has a tag 'Ensembl_canonical' will be kept
# isoform: whether to filter by isoform number, if no isoform filtering is needed, set isoform='0' (default)
# for older version of gencode gtfs, the tag 'Ensemble_canonical' does not exist. In this case, please use isoform filtering
# accodring to gencode format, isoform must be a 3 digit number string, for example, '201', '202', '203', etc.
# isoform number support regular expression, for example, '[0-9]01' will match 101, 201, 301 up to 901.
# if isoform filtering is turned on, only sequences that has the feature type 'transcript' 
# and has a transcript_name ('Gm37180-201') that contains the isoform number (201) will be kept
# please refer to Gencode data format for further details: https://www.gencodegenes.org/pages/data_format.html
# rm_dup: whether to remove duplicated sequences, rm_dup=False is the default. 
# If rm_dup=True, sequences that are exactly the same will be removed and only the first occurence will be kept
# outputname: the name of the output fasta file, default is 'test', a trailing part '.fa' will be added to the outputname to ensure fasta format


#### Output:
# fasta file (.fa) with the name of outputname.fa that is filtered by length and/or by transcript feature type and Ensemble_canonical tag and/or isoform number and/or duplicated sequences

### Example:
# headers, seqs = filter_gencode(fasta_path='gencode.vM33.lncRNA_transcripts.fa', 
#                                gtf_path='gencode.vM33.long_noncoding_RNAs.gtf',
#                                len_threshold=500, canonical=True, isoform='201',
#                                rm_dup=True, outputname='test')
